***

## Definition
- A FSDS is someone who knows the E2E (‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù) of a data science project. From getting the data, cleanign the data, applying feature engineering, model building, model validation, model optimisation as well as model deployment.

- Also known as "full-pipe" data scientist.

## No-longer valid division
- Data teams had: data engineers to build pipelines, data scientists to perform statistical analysis and/or build a model, and ML engineers to deploy a model in scale.
- This comes at a much much greater cost for companies and now a single individual may be aske to do all of these.
