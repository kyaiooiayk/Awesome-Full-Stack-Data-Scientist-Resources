Resources to help you become a FSDS - Full Stack Data Scientist
***

## Definition
- A FSDS is someone who knows the E2E (‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù) of a data science project. From getting the data, cleanign the data, applying feature engineering, model building, model validation, model optimisation as well as model deployment.
- DA FSDS is a melting pot of the following: Statician, Data Scientist, Machine Learnign Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Steward, Data Analyst, Data Architect, Data Ops, Data Dev‚Ä¶
- Also known as "full-pipe" data scientist.
***

## No-longer valid division
- Data teams had: data engineers to build pipelines, data scientists to perform statistical analysis and/or build a model, and ML engineers to deploy a model in scale.
- This comes at a much much greater cost for companies and now a single individual may be aske to do all of these.

| Role | Next Cousing (Before the data boom) | Skills | Tools |
| - | - | - | - |
| Data scientist | Staticitian | Coding, statistics, machine learning | Python, R |
| Data analyst | - | RDB, data exploration, visualization, communication | SQL |
| Data engineer | Software Engineer| Data pipelines, data quality and testing | Python, Spark |
| Machine learning engineer | Software Engineer | Building APIs, containerization, cloud | Python, C++, Java |
| MLOps engineer | Software Engineer, DevOpt, Full Stack Engineer | Building APIs, containerization, cloud, model monitoring | Python, Java |

## MLOps vs. FSDS
- Is there any difference btw a MLOps engineer and a full stack data scientist? Pobably yes, and MLOps is probably the closest role to FSDS. If you are currently in one of these roles you may experience something similar or different to what I am going to say next.
- Data Scientists ironically focus more on Machine Learning algorithms than does an MLOps Engineer. You could even go as far as saying an MLOps Engineer is a Software Engineer traditionally who has then added the specialisation of deployment and production parts of the overall Data Science process.
- MLOps engineer are generally given models developed by Data Scientists. Their role would be to optimise some of the Data Science code, create an API and deploy the model in production.
