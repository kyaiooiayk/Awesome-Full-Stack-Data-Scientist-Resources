Resources to help you become a FSDS - Full Stack Data Scientist
***

## Definition
- A FSDS is someone who knows the E2E (“end-to-end”) of a data science project. From getting the data, cleanign the data, applying feature engineering, model building, model validation, model optimisation as well as model deployment.
- DA FSDS is a melting pot of the following: Statician, Data Scientist, Machine Learnign Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Steward, Data Analyst, Data Architect, Data Ops, Data Dev…
- Also known as "full-pipe" data scientist.

## No-longer valid division
- Data teams had: data engineers to build pipelines, data scientists to perform statistical analysis and/or build a model, and ML engineers to deploy a model in scale.
- This comes at a much much greater cost for companies and now a single individual may be aske to do all of these.

| Role | Skills | Tools |
| - | - | - |
| Data scientist | Coding, statistics, machine learning | Python, R |
| Data analyst | RDB, data exploration, visualization, communication | SQL |
| Data engineer | Data pipelines, data quality and testing | Python, Spark |
| Machine learning engineer | Building APIs, containerization, cloud, model monitoring | Python, Java |
